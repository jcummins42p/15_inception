NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. It is know for high performance, stability, and low resource consumption.

- It is often used to handle server-side requests for web applications
- Can also be used to serve static content such as images and JavaScript files.
- Can be configured to handle other network protocols:
	- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
	- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Often used in conjunction with other software, such as databases and CMS

TLS - Transport Layer Security
- is a security protocol that is udes to establish secure communication between two parties over the internet.
- designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery
- provide authenticity and itegrity for trasmitted data.
- Used to secure a wide range of internet-based applications
	- web browsing
	- file transfer
	- virtual private networks (VPN)
	- real-time communication systems

TLS works by using public key encryption to establish a secure connection between two parties. When a client wants to communicate with a server using TLS, the client and server exchange a series of messages to establish a secure connection. This process includes the exchange of digital cerfificates and the negotiation of encryption keys. Once the connection is established, the client and server can communicate securely over the internet.

TLS is the successr to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which was developed in the 1990s. TLS is based on SSL, but it has been updated to address a number off security vulnerabilities that were discovered in SSL. TLS is now the de facto standard for secure communication on the internet, and it us used by millions of websites and applications to protect sensitive data.

OpenSSL
- open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols.
- widely used for working with SSL and TLS, and available for most OSes
- Can be used for a variety of tasks related to SSL and TLS:
	- Creating and managing SSL/TLS certificates and private keys
	- Setting up and configuring SSL/TLS-enabled servers
	- Connecting to SSL/TLS-enabled servers as a client
	- Debugging SSL/TLS connections
	- Generating and signing digital certificates
- OpenSSL is often used by system admins and devs to secure communication between servers and clients.
- To create secure tunnels for transmitting data over teh internet.
- To create secure and encrypted connections for email, file transfer, and other types of inernet communication.
